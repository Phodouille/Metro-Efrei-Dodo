# 🗺️ Paris Metro Route Planner

A route planning and graph analysis project for the Parisian metro network, designed to help users compute optimal routes, visualize the transit graph, and analyze network properties.

Depending on the version implemented (V1, V2, or V3), the project progressively adds real-world data handling and advanced transport planning features.

## ✅ Must-Have Features (All Versions)

- 🧭 **Shortest Path Computation**  
  Compute and display the shortest itinerary between two metro stations in a clear and user-friendly format.

- 🌳 **Minimum Spanning Tree (ACPM)**  
  Visualize an arborescence of the metro network using algorithms like Prim or Kruskal.

- 🔄 **Network Connectivity Check**  
  Test whether the entire metro network is connected (i.e., every station is reachable from any other).

## ✳️ Should-Have Features (Version 2 & 3)

- 📍 **2024 Paris Metro Data Integration**  
  Use real data from the current 2024 Paris metro network to enhance accuracy and realism.

---

## 💡 Could-Have Features (Version 3)

- ⏱️ **Time-Aware Routing**  
  Incorporate actual line schedules and transfer times at stations to calculate the fastest route, not just the shortest.

---

## 🎯 Bonus Features (Version 3+)

- 🚆 **RER Integration**  
  Include RER (suburban train) lines in the route planning logic.

- 📅 **Arrival Time-Based Planning**  
  Allow users to input a desired **arrival time** instead of a departure time and calculate when they should leave accordingly.

- ♿ **Accessibility Considerations**  
  Factor in station accessibility information for wheelchair users to provide inclusive route suggestions.
